This library is a python port of McIDAS Area java reader/writer
part of the edu.wisc.ssec.mcidas Java package/jar


It mostly mimics the Java package structure and logic with few expcetions
imposed by practical aspects of python language.

Some additional more efficient functions were added to GVARNav class (toLineEle2, toLatLon2). Use these
 to perform navigation. They work with numpy arrays.


 The navigation code is not very efficient in terms of speed and  optimisations could help (making sure to allocate as little memory as possible and reuse it as much as possible)

 The AreaDirectory and AreaFile classes have a unpythonic look and feel and could be rewritten from scratch in future

 I have never used the calibratin module myself so it was not tested at all.


 The AreaFIle can be instantiated from a file or a binary string.

 The AreaFile  is lightweight, it features lazy initialisation (reads the data only upon request)

  I am not sure if a multiband AreaFile would be read correctly. I have not tested it becauzse 90% of the AreaFiles I encountered were single band images

   The data property returns a 3D numpy array, use squueze to get a 2D version.
